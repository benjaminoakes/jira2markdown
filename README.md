# jira2markdown

Simple (or too simple?) Jira to Markdown converter

[Use it here](https://benjaminoakes.github.io/jira2markdown/)

I threw this together because I was often writing Markdown for GitHub but Jira-style markup for Jira.  Tiny differences got in the way when I needed to copy/paste and retain formatting.  It only really converts formatting that I use frequently.
